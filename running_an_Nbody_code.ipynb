    "One of the parameters in the binary is the *hardness*.\n",
    "what is the hardness of the binary from your last run, and explain what is meant with this parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3:\n",
    "Rewrite the script in such a way that the event loop over time continues indefinitely, but that the code stops as soon as the first binary is detected.\n",

    "Now redo the calculation in which you generate a histogram of moments of first-binary formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make one figure with both distributions: the original distribution for first-binary formation time and the second series of runs (with the altered initial conditions.\n",
    "Present both distributions as histograms and as cumulative distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3:\n",
    "Can you understand the difference in first-binary formation-time based on the changes you introduced in the initial conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you perform enough runs to make a statistically significant statement about the time of first-binary formation?\n",

    "### Question 4:\n",
    "Can you understand the difference between the typical masses of the binaries that formed first and the initial mass-function?"
