    "AMUSE is composed of domain-specific modules (i.e. the physics modules), which are often written in some native compiled language, and data-handling.\n",
    "the latter tends to be confusing for novel users.\n",
    "Data representation in AMUSE is often replicated.\n",
    "So can there be a parameter *mass* to indicate a property of a star in a stellar-evolution code, in a gravitational dynamics code and in your user script. These three parameters *mass* can mean the same, or they can have a different meaning. This makes running amuse somewhat confusing at times.\n",
    "Here we show how to formally separate these data streams.\n",
