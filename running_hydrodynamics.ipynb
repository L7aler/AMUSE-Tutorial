    "====================\n",

    "We will run a hydrodynamical simulation using a smoothed-particles hydrodynamics code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference you can read chapter 5 of Portegies Zwart & McMillan 2018 (2018araa.book.....P). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment, we will evolve a high-mass star to the end of it's lifetime using a Henyey stellar evolution code (this may take a while).\n",
    "We subsequently convert the star to a hydrodynamical realization in particles and inject the supernova energy to the inner few SPH-particles. We further simulate the evolution of the gas-blob in time using a hydrodynamics code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script in this notebook is based on the work by (Rimoldi et al.)[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ComAC...3....2R/abstract].\n",

    "You have performed a hydrodynamical explosion of a star that is experiencing a supernova. This was realized by first evolving the star to an advanced state using a 1D stellar evolution (a so-called Henyey) code. this one-dimensional structure was subsequently converted to a 3-dimensional hydrodynamical distribution of particles, representing the core and the gaseous envelope.\n",
    "\n",
    "We injected a supernova-amount of energy into the hydrodynamical blob, heating the inner most particles to extreemely high temperatures and let the hydrodynamical code calculste the response.\n",
    "The result was calculated 1 second, 1 minute, 1 hour and 1 day after the explosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignmnets and questions:\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the script is configured for running with 1000 SPH particles, which is too small to study the morphology of the final simulation results, 1 day after the initiation of the supernova. Try running with 10000 SPH particles, of better even would be to run with 30000 particles. However, the runs will become rather expensive. Most questions you can answer with ony 1000 SPH harticles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to speed-up the code would be by not letting the stellar evolution code run all the way util it crashes. In particular the last few steps are time consuming and do not really chage much to that part of the star in which we are most interested (the density gradient between the core-region and the envrlope. This part is already converged to it's final density profile once the star ascends the first asymptotic giant branch. You can shorten runtime considerably by allowing the star to evolve to that point in it's evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 1:\n",
    "Each time we run the script a new star is evolved until the stellar-evolution code crashes. These runs are rather expensive, and as so long as we do not change the mass of the star we repeat the same calculation each time we restart the script. This is rather wasteful for computer cycles, and for the environment. \n",
    "You can use the internal amuse routine *get_path_to_results* to store the picke file in your local amuse repository in $AMUSE_DIR/test_results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the necessary lines to the *setup_stellar_evolution_model* script in which the star is evolved to picke the result of the stellar evolution calculation if a new calculation is performed. But first check if the desired pickled star already exist, in which case you should not redo the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, change the scipt in which the star is evolve to let it run until the star has reached the asymptotic giant branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1:\n",
    "In the routine *inject_supernova_energy* we use a *lambda* function. Explain what this function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2:\n",
    "In the three images, after running for 1 second, 1 minute and 1 hour, the star only seem to change color in the images. Explain why this is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assigment 2:\n",
    "In the routing *plot_hydro* we assign various parameters to the colors red, green and blue, and to the transparancy alpha. Explain what these parameters main, and how this translates to the various colors you observed in the plotted pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3:\n",
    "Rerun the calculation but plot the kinetic energy, the potential energy and the total energy of the gas as a function of time from the start of the supernova to 2 days after the supernova. Describe the furves and explain what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions 3:\n",
    "check the velocity of the neutron star at the end of the simulation.\n",
    "It is not zero, as it was initially. Why is this the case?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4:\n",
    "Usually neutron stars are believed to recieve rather high \"natal\" kicks upon birth. We still do not really understand why. In our simulations, we can introduce such a kick velocity by hand. A reasonable kick for a neutron star could be about 250km/s.\n",
    "Impose such a high velocity kick to the newly born neutron star at the moment of the actual explosion and rerung the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4:\n",
    "What effect that the high natal velocity kick of the neutron star has on the morphology and energy budget of the hydrodynamical outflow of the supernova shell?\n",
    "\n",
